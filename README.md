## Contributing

To contribute you will want to see how your changes look locally. In order to do this you should:

1. Ensure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
2. Clone this repo locally. This will add the repo to your local files.
```git
git clone https://github.com/logseq/docs.git
``` 
3. Add the repo to Logseq via the `Add new graph`button on the top left dropdown menu. Select the directory where you cloned the repo.
4. Create a branch off of master. The following two commands create a branch called `branch-name` and navigates onto it.

```git
git branch branch-name
git checkout branch-name
```
5. Make your edits and confirm they look good in Logseq. Then, commit them using `git commit -m "message"` and `git push` and submit a pull request onto GitHub!
