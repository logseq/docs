## Contributing

Thank you! Looking for something to contribute on documents? There's a [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/logseq/projects/5/views/1?filterQuery=label%3Adocumentation)

To contribute you will want to see how your changes look locally. In order to do this you should:

1. Ensure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
2. Fork and Clone THIS REPO. If you have no idea to do, check [This](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop). The upstream should be set to the FORKED REPO.
3. Add the cloned local repo (of your FORKED REPO) to Logseq via the `Add new graph`button on the top left dropdown menu. Select the directory where you cloned the repo.
4. Create a branch off of master. The following two commands create a branch called `branch-name` and navigates onto it.

```git
git branch branch-name
git checkout branch-name
```
5. Make your edits and confirm they look good in Logseq. Then, commit them using `git commit -m "message"` and `git push` and submit a pull request onto GitHub!

If you are making large changes to the documentation, please open an issue to discuss them first.
