title: Publishing (Desktop App Only)
---

- To provide the best publishing experience, Logseq at this moment only supports publishing on the desktop app.
- How to publish?
	-
	  1. Click the page titles that you wish to publish, select "Make it public for publishing" in the right pop-up menu.

		- You can also choose to make all the pages public by navigating to [[Settings]] -> Editor and enabling the option "All pages public when publishing."

	  2. Click the top-right three-dots and select `Export graph`. Then select a folder, and Logseq will export all the files needed for publishing there.

	- 3. The exported assets basically make up a web application, when runs Logseq with your public pages, in read-only mode. After exporting, if you are on Linux-like environment, you can `cd` into the export folder and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. VoilÃ ðŸŽ‰, you can now visit the published graph at `localhost:8000` in your browser.
	- 4. Of course publishing your beautiful graph on localhost only is not that fun. Since we have all the assets now, publish them on platforms like [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs) is straightforward. Below is a video tutorial on how to publish Logseq pages to Github Pages.
