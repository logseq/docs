  #+BEGIN_TIP 
  - Clicking a backlink will open the linked page in the main window
  - Shift + clicking a backlink will open the linked page in the sidebar
  - Opening a backlink to a page which does not currently exist will create a new page with the backlink text as its title
  - The [[Unlinked References]] list located below [[Linked References]] on a page displays potential backlinks, files which refer to the page but do not have a relevant backlink present.
