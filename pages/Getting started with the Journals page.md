- #+BEGIN_TIP
  For people familiar with Roam Research: the Journals page in Logseq is the same as the Daily Notes Page in Roam.
  #+END_TIP
- Every time you open Logseq, you start on the Journals page.
- The Journals page is the ideal place to enter information in your graph. Every day at midnight a new Journals page is created with that day's date, making it easy to see when you've added what information.
- Here is also where mentions of that day's date will resurface, in the linked references of each day's Journals page. This is handy for when you want to send your future self reminders or TODOs.
- When it's your first time using an outliner tool like Logseq, we recommend you write everything on the Journals page of that day. Avoid creating pages for everything and scattering your information over unconnected islands. Until you know how to link pages and blocks—and even after—it's best to use your Journals pages for everything.
