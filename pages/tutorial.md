## Getting Started

## **1. Let's create a page** - called [[How to Take Notes]]. Type `[[]]` to create or reference any other page. You can also make a new page in the search bar.
### You can click it to actually go to that page, or you can `Shift+Click` to open it in the right sidebar! At the bottom, you'll see both _Linked References_ and _Unlinked References_ - every single other time you thought about it inside Logseq.
## **2. Let's reference some blocks** - In [[How to Take Notes]] , you can `Shift+Click` any page or block reference to open it in the right sidebar. Try making some changes on the right sidebar, those referenced blocks will be changed too!
### ((60293d41-1351-40ed-aa00-0e0c12be1175)) : This is a block reference.
### ((60293d41-2c37-43f2-aa0e-4e0ad8e38531)) : This is another block reference.
## **3. Embed a Block** - References aren't enough! I wan't to see and edit any block in my entire Graph! You can embed entire blocks and their children by typing `/` and selecting `Block Embed` :
### {{embed ((6018cc98-67a8-4eb2-bfd7-2affe517a7c7)) }}
## **4. Embed a Page** - What if I want to embed the whole page? The `/` menu has a option for that - `Page Embed` :
### {{{embed [[How to Take Notes]] }}}
## **5. Use Tags** - Use tags to categorize any page or block, then click on it to see every single time you used it!
### Check out this #dummy tag.

:END:
## **6. Manage your Tasks + Todos** - Do you support tasks like todo/doing/done and priorities?
### Yes, type press `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` inside a block to cycle through different TODO statuses or `/` and pick your favorite todo keyword or priority (A/B/C).
