## Since I started my new job as a software manager, I realized I have to take more and more notes. Initially, I started out with notion but I just couldn't. Too much clutter. 
After Notion, I found Logseq and I felt this is for me. I started taking notes and as a person that didn't take notes before, I saw that how much the structure of Logseq was and is helping me. 
After finding Logseq, I tries different note-taking apps: Dynalist, Workflowy, Remnote, Obsidian, Foam, Dendron, Zettlr,... But at the end, I would always find my way back to Logseq. I've never used Roam before, I don't know how it is and I don't think I have to try it because I see how good Logseq is. 
Great job Logseq team and all the best. Please make the app stable and I hope with the help of the community, you can get rid of the bugs and catch up with your technical debt.
