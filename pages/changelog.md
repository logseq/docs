		  {{embed ((60311eda-b6f7-4779-8187-8830545b3a64)) }}
		- **Smarter** [[queries]]
		  Previously, `(and [[Project 1]] (todo now))` will only query those blocks that have both the `Project 1` reference and a `NOW` marker. Now it works as long as if the block parents have the `Project 1` reference and the block has a `NOW` marker.
		  #+BEGIN_NOTE
		  Make sure to unlink your graph first and import your data to make it works!
		  #+END_NOTE
			- For example:
			  {{query (and [[Project 1]] (todo now))}}
			- [[Project 1]]
				- NOW Do something
				  now:: 1613831559033
